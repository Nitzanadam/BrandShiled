ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

WHAT WOULD HAVE YOU DONE DIFFERENTLY, IF EBAY BLOCKED YOUR IP?
If eBay blocked my Ip, I should use proxy servers to send my requests through a series of different IP addresses. It makes my real IP hidden, and I can keep scraping with the same program.

HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE THE PROCESS IN ORDER TO RETRIEVE MORE ITEMS?
To improve the process of retrieving more items through web scraping, I would consider using multi-threading. By dividing the scraping work among several threads, I can make the data scraping more efficient. 
Each thread works on a different page and saves the information it collects in its own list.  when the thread completes scraping a page, we append the list to shared data collection (ensuring data security), and we use this collection to extract all the data we need.

IN WHAT WAYS COULD YOU IMPROVE THE PROCESS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF AI? 
AI can improve web scraping by utilizing it for data extraction in our web scraping. for example, in this assignment, we could use it to extract some properties for each product in eBay, and it can analyze faster the long and complicated HTML and write a script to extract exactly what we want.
